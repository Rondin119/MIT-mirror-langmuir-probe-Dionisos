Notes for Sep 17 run day for MLP Testing
The major diffrence between this set of tests and the last one is the increase in the smothing averager window and increased data save rate.

Calibration for Rp1:
there was an issue with the calibration scripts that needed to be diagnosed, I removed the vast majority of the break point architectre and it worked so I am not questioning it. I suspect it is likely due to the increased sample rate, or higher speed calibration, but I am ot sure. Regardless I am now confident that Rp 1 is correctly calibrated with values:

MLP_driver.set_scale_PC(int(-1.1*1024))
MLP_driver.set_offset_PC(int(int2signed(-95), 2))

MLP_driver.set_scale_LB(int(1.1*1024))
MLP_driver.set_offset_LB(int(int2signed(136), 2))

MLP_driver.set_scale_Out(int(.97*1024))
MLP_driver.set_offset_Out(int(int2signed(-5), 2))

The input callibration was done by inputing a 20kHz 1.5 volt peak to peak signal to both the rp and an ocilliscope. The two measurements were then plotted in matlab. We assume that the scope is reading the "true" signal accuratly. This gives us a dc offset and amplitude discrepencey that can be accounted for via the manual calibration blocks in the FPGA.
