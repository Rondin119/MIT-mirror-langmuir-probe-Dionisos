Runs: 


Shot1:
-plasma conditions: plasma shot, good traces
- strange beat frequency thing

Shot2: 
-plasma conditions: plasma shot, good traces
-same as 1
 
shot3: 
-plasma conditions: plasma, 
-Changed scale to be negative



shot4: 
-plasma conditions: plasma, lower density 
-Changed scale to be negative

shot5: 
-plasma conditions: plasma, lower density 
-Changed scale to be positive
-locking on to a low value, dont know why, possibly the amp is not giving what I requested and is causing the lock to go off

Shot6:
-plasma conditions: plasma, 10 Hz fluctuation
-increasing aquisition time

Shot7:
-plasma conditions: plasma, 40 Hz fluctuation
-Can see wiggle, calculates transient values to start, works its way to very locked

Shot8:
-plasma conditions: plasma, increased density
-remained very locked at low temperature

Shot9:
-plasma conditions: back to lower power
-removed capacitive coupling
